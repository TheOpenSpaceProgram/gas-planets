gas-planets
===========

Gas planet textures generated using gaseous-giganticus from [Space Nerds in Space](https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space) ([reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2f6cl5/procedural_generation_of_gas_giant_planets/))

gaseous-giganticus (the file in the root of this repository) is a compiled version for Linux. You need libpng and zlib. I'm looking into cross-compiling for Windows, although it seems somewhat unlikely.
