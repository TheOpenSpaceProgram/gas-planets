===========

Gas planet textures generated using gaseous-giganticus from [Space Nerds in Space](https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space) ([reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2f6cl5/procedural_generation_of_gas_giant_planets/))

gaseous-giganticus.linux64 (the file in the root of this repository) is a compiled version for 64-bit Linux. You need libpng and zlib.

gaseous-giganticus.macos64 is compiled for 64-bit macOS. It was compiled on 10.11 (el capitan) and clang seems to have marked it as only compatible with 10.10+. I don't know if it will work on previous versions. It doesn't require libpng as it contains a statically linked version.

Still not sure about Windows version. File an issue if you really need it. For now the Linux version should work under WSL.
